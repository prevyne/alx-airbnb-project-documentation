Of course. Here is the documentation for the Use Case Diagram, formatted for a README.md file. This explanation focuses solely on the diagram's meaning and components, without mentioning any specific tools used to create it.

Use Case Diagram for the Airbnb Clone Backend
This document provides a detailed explanation of the Use Case diagram for the Airbnb Clone project. The diagram's primary purpose is to visualize the interactions between different users (known as actors) and the system itself. It offers a high-level view of the system's functionalities and illustrates who can perform which actions.

What is a Use Case Diagram?
A Use Case Diagram shows the relationships between actors and the different actions they can perform within the system. Each action, or "use case," represents a specific piece of functionality that provides value to the user. This helps in understanding the system's scope and requirements from a user's perspective.

Actors
Actors are the external entities that interact with our system. For the Airbnb Clone, we have identified the following key actors:

Guest: A user who browses the platform to search for, book, and review property listings.

Host: A user who owns properties and uses the platform to list them, manage bookings, and communicate with guests.

Admin: A privileged user responsible for the overall management and supervision of the platform, including users, listings, and bookings.

Payment Gateway: An external, third-party system (like Stripe or PayPal) that securely processes all financial transactions.

OAuth Provider: An external authentication service (like Google or Facebook) that allows users to sign up or log in using their existing social accounts.

Diagram Breakdown and Key Scenarios
The diagram illustrates the various workflows within the system. Here are some of the key scenarios:

Core User Actions
Both Guests and Hosts share a set of fundamental actions:

They can Register Account to join the platform.

They can Log In / Log Out to access their accounts.

They can Manage Profile to update their personal information.

Guest-Specific Actions
Property Discovery: A Guest can Search for Properties and can optionally Filter Search Results to narrow down the options.

Booking a Property: The central action for a Guest is to Book Property. This action requires them to Make Payment, which is a mandatory step. The system then interacts with the external Payment Gateway to handle this transaction.

Post-Stay Actions: After a booking is complete, a Guest can Write Review to share their experience. They can also Cancel Booking based on the platform's policies.

Host-Specific Actions
Listing Management: A Host's primary role is to Create Listing to add a new property and Manage Listings to update or remove existing ones.

Booking and Review Management: Hosts can manage their bookings and can Respond to Review left by guests.

Admin-Specific Actions
Platform Oversight: The Admin has high-level permissions to Manage Users, Manage Listings, and Manage Bookings across the entire platform to ensure everything runs smoothly.

Special Relationships (include and extend)
You will notice special labels on the lines connecting some of the use cases. Hereâ€™s what they mean in simple terms:

<<include>>: This represents a mandatory function. For example, the Book Property use case includes the Make Payment use case. This means you cannot book a property without also making a payment.

<<extend>>: This represents an optional function. For example, the Log In / Log Out use case can be extended by the Log In with OAuth use case. This means a user can log in with their email and password, or they can choose the optional method of logging in with Google or Facebook.
