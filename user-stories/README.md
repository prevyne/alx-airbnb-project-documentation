User Stories for the Airbnb Clone Project
This document outlines the key user stories for the Airbnb Clone project. User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They help to capture the "who," "what," and "why" of a requirement in a simple, concise way.

The standard format is: "As a [user type], I want [an action], so that [a benefit]."

Core User Stories
Here are the user stories that capture the essential interactions and functionalities of the platform, derived from our system's use cases.

I want to search for and book a property for specific dates,

so that I can secure accommodation for my trip.

2. Host Listing a Property

I want to create a detailed property listing with photos, descriptions, and pricing,

so that I can attract and rent it out to potential guests.

3. Guest Leaving a Review

so that I can share my experience with the community and help future travelers make informed decisions.

4. User Registration with Social Media
